# hello-world
This repository contain my very first project in programming, i'm not any kind of tech scientist. I'm brazilian, and i have bachelors degree in economics. I started programming to build up projects who can improve technologies principaly in academic researches, basic education and cybersecurity
I do not master any programming language yet, but i'm on my way at programming in python. I started with this language after a quick reserach at the web and social medias from people who already develop programs.
